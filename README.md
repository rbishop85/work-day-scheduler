# work-day-scheduler
Basic work day calendar application




Day 2 pre-class notes:
8-5 = business hours stored in 24hr system so numbers keep progressing

3 style sets for past present and future events linked to classes

"text area" form input element for multiple lines of text

when clicking save button there is a notice at top of page saying it was added to schedule
    - data saved to individual local storage keys for each hour of day "hour-9 etc"

All css already written in css file, disect it to try and find planned html layout
  -- You can style your own if you wish

// Declare current time
  // date.now for vanilla javascript

 // data-hour="9" for event.target to pull the data-hour from the button clicked

 for loop should also be reaching into local storage to pull saved data for each hour
